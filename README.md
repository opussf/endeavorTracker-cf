# endeavorTracker

WoW Addon to track Endeavors.

## What this shows

It shows:
In the title: Your house level, current house XP, house XP for next level
In the first bar:  The endeavor points (your contribution) / total points.
Each bar shows: Progress Contribution, Task title, task progress text.

The bars are sorted, and the length of them is based on the Progress Contribution.
The closer to the top, and the longer the bar, the more points you get for that task.

/et help  :: shows the help.
/et chat  :: toggles text output on progress
/et reset :: resets window location
